- Dart SDK (version 3.7.2 or later)
- An IDE such as Android Studio, VS Code, or IntelliJ IDEA
- Android or iOS device/emulator for testing
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```  
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**  
   ```
   cd flutter/efgh/abcd
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   Run the following command to fetch all required packages:

   Execute:  
   ```
   flutter run
   ```  
   Select the target device if prompted. The app will build and launch on the selected device.

3. **Hot reload**  
   While the app is running, you can use hot reload to apply code changes instantly by pressing `r` in the terminal or using your IDE's hot reload feature.

## Building for Release
